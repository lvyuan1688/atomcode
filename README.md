---

AtomCode is an AI coding agent that lives in your terminal. Give it a task in natural language, and it will read your codebase, edit files, run commands, and verify its work — autonomously.

Think of it as an open-source alternative to Claude Code / Cursor Agent, but running entirely in your terminal and connecting to any OpenAI-compatible API.

## Features

### Agent Loop

- **Autonomous multi-step execution** — reads files, edits code, runs tests, fixes errors, all in a loop
- **Verification loop** — automatically verifies edits via syntax checks before declaring success
- **Dynamic step budget** — scales with the number of edited files, capped per turn to bound cost
- **Loop detection** — detects and breaks out of repetitive tool-call patterns
- **3-layer JSON repair** — recovers malformed tool-call arguments
- **Turn-level datalog** — structured per-turn logs for replay, debugging, and eval harnesses

### Modes & Autonomy

- **Plan / Build modes** — `/plan` switches to read-only exploration (the agent investigates without touching files); `/build` switches back to full execution
- **Goal mode** — `/goal <text>` sets a completion condition and the agent loops autonomously, turn after turn, until the goal is met
- **Code review** — `/review` reviews your current changes, `/review staged` the staged diff, and `/review <base>` against a base ref
- **Background sessions** — `/bg` runs work in detached slots so you can keep using the TUI while a long task progresses

### Built-in Tools

File & shell:

- `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `search_replace`
- `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `list_directory`, `change_dir`
- `web_search`, `web_fetch`

Code graph (language-aware code intelligence):

- `list_symbols`, `read_symbol`, `find_references`
- `trace_callers`, `trace_callees`, `trace_chain`
- `file_deps`, `blast_radius`

Automation:

- `auto_fix` — automatic lint/typecheck fix loop
- `use_skill` — invoke a user-defined skill

### Multi-Provider Support

Connect to any LLM that supports OpenAI's function-calling API:

| Provider | Function Calling | Tested Models |
|----------|:---:|---|
| Claude (Anthropic) | Yes | Claude Sonnet 4.5/4.6, Opus 4.6 |
| OpenAI | Yes | GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 |
| DeepSeek | Yes | DeepSeek V3, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek V4 |
| Zhipu (GLM) | Yes | GLM-4, GLM-5 |
| Qwen (Alibaba) | Yes | Qwen-Plus, Qwen-Max |
| SiliconFlow | Yes | Various open models |
| Ollama (local) | Partial | Llama 3, Qwen2, etc. |
| Any OpenAI-compatible API | Yes | — |

### Sessions & Login

- **Persistent sessions** — every conversation is saved; continue the last session with `atomcode --continue` / `-c`, or resume/switch inside the TUI with `/resume`
- **AtomGit OAuth login** — `/login` (or `atomcode login`) pairs your CLI with your AtomGit account
- **SSO login** — `/login-with-sso` for GitCode internal users
- **Headless mode** — `atomcode -p "..."` runs a single prompt non-interactively and streams the reply on stdout (Claude Code `-p` style); approval-required `bash` calls are auto-approved, while other approval-required tools are denied
- **Daemon mode** — `atomcode-daemon` exposes an HTTP API for session history and SSE streaming chat

### Terminal UI

- **Real-time streaming** with markdown rendering and syntax highlighting
- **Code blocks** with language labels, line numbers, and `base16-ocean.dark` theme
- **Multi-line input** with Shift+Enter (or `\` + Enter), auto-growing height, input history
- **Task completion notifications** — long-running tasks trigger terminal-native notifications first (kitty / WezTerm / iTerm2), falling back to OS-native alerts
- **Text selection** with mouse drag, auto-scroll, and clipboard copy
- **Slash commands** — `/model`, `/provider`, `/resume`, `/bg`, `/diff`, `/undo`, `/cost`, `/clear`, `/compact`, etc. (see table below)
- **File attachment** — paste file paths to attach content as context
- **Bracketed paste** — long paste content collapsed to a compact indicator
- **Skills** — user-defined commands loaded from your skill directory, invoked like any slash command

### Web UI

- **`/webui`** (in the TUI) or **`atomcode webui`** (CLI) launches a local browser UI as an alternative to the terminal interface — same agent, same sessions, rendered in your browser
- **Loopback only** — the server binds to `127.0.0.1` and uses a one-time token; nothing is exposed to the network
- **`/webui stop`** stops the in-process server (a later `/webui` restarts it)

### App Remote Access

- **`/app`** (in the TUI) enables mobile remote access — prints a QR code; scan it with the GitCode mobile app from any network to connect to your current session
- **Any-network reachable** — your PC connects to a public relay via a reverse WSS tunnel; the phone reaches your PC through the relay. No public IP, DDNS, or port forwarding required
- **Bidirectional real-time sync** — messages from either end appear on the other in real time (streaming replies, tool call cards, token usage)
- **Tool approval** — when a restricted tool is about to run, an approval card appears on the phone; approve or deny with one tap
- **Remote commands** — the phone can run `/status`, `/cost`, `/diff`, `/whoami` etc., which execute on the desktop and echo results back
- **Switch projects / sessions** — switch projects or open a history session on the phone, and the desktop follows immediately
- **Model sync** — switching models on either end keeps the other in sync
- **`/app stop`** disconnects remote access

### Safety

- **Destructive command detection** — `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, etc. require explicit approval
- **Path-aware confirmations** — external reads, sensitive paths, and all writes outside the workspace can require confirmation depending on risk level
- **Sensitive file protection** — protected system paths, credential directories, shell configs, `.env` files, and key/cert files receive stronger confirmation rules
- **Shell bypass protection** — common shell file commands like `cat`, `head`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and `tee` inherit the same path approval model as file tools
- **Per-session permission grants** — approve once per tool pattern, or always-allow
- **Source file deletion requires approval** — `rm` on code files is never auto-approved
- **Undo** — `/undo` rolls back the last turn's file edits via file-history snapshots

See [Permission Model](./docs/security/permission-model.md) for the full design and current boundaries.

### Privacy

## Installation

### From Source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://atomgit.com/atomgit_atomcode/atomcode.git
cd atomcode
cargo install --path crates/atomcode-cli --locked
```

The binary will be generated at `target/release/atomcode` and installed to
`~/.cargo/bin/atomcode` for macOS / Linux / HarmonyOS PC and `$env:USERPROFILE/.cargo/bin/atomcode.exe`
for Windows. Make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows) is
in your `PATH`.

To compile without installing, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

and the binary will be generated at `target/release/atomcode`.

### Package Managers

AtomCode CLI can also be installed via the following package managers:

```bash
# Install using npm
npm install -g @atomgit.com/atomcode

# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask atomcode
```

### Requirements

- Rust 1.88+ (for building; older Cargo versions cannot parse the current lockfile)
- An API key from any supported provider (or an AtomGit account for `/login`)

### Uninstall

Remove AtomCode and (optionally) its data:

```bash
atomcode uninstall                # interactive: per-group prompts
atomcode uninstall --keep-data    # only remove binary + PATH edit
atomcode uninstall --purge        # remove everything, including ~/.atomcode
atomcode uninstall --dry-run      # show plan, change nothing
```

If the binary is already broken or missing:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.atomgit.com/atomgit_atomcode/atomcode/raw/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh
# Windows:
irm https://raw.atomgit.com/atomgit_atomcode/atomcode/raw/main/scripts/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

By default credentials (`auth.toml`, `mcp.json`, `config.toml`, `ATOMCODE.md`) are kept; pass `--purge` to remove them too.

## Quick Start

### 1. First Run

```bash
atomcode
```

On first run, a setup wizard will guide you through configuring your LLM provider:

```
Welcome to AtomCode! Let's set up your first provider.

Select provider:
  [1] Claude (Anthropic)
  [2] OpenAI
  [3] OpenAI Compatible (DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu, Moonshot...)
  [4] Ollama (local)
```

### 2. Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.atomcode/config.toml`. A minimal single-provider
setup looks like this:

```toml
default_provider = "deepseek"

[providers.deepseek]
type           = "openai"
api_key        = "sk-..."
model          = "deepseek-chat"
base_url       = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
context_window = 64000
```

You can declare multiple providers and switch between them with `/model`
or `/provider`. A **complete reference** covering Claude / OpenAI /
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (DeepSeek, GLM, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter...) /
Ollama, plus the `[datalog]` section, lives at
[`docs/config.example.toml`](docs/config.example.toml) — copy and edit the
bits you need.

After editing `config.toml` by hand, run `/reload` inside atomcode to pick
up the changes without restarting.

### 3. Start Coding

```bash
# Open in your project directory
cd your-project
atomcode

# Or specify directory
atomcode -C /path/to/project

# Or specify model
atomcode --model gpt-4o

# Headless (single prompt, reply on stdout)
atomcode -p "Explain the agent loop in this repo"

# Read prompt from file
atomcode --prompt-file task.md
```

In headless mode, approval-required `bash` calls are auto-approved and logged to stderr; other approval-required tools are denied.

Then just type what you want:

```
> Fix the login bug where users get redirected to 404 after OAuth callback

> Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page

> Refactor the database module to use connection pooling

> Write tests for the payment processing module
```

## Keybindings

### Input

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | New line (requires Kitty keyboard protocol) |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | New line (requires Kitty keyboard protocol) |
| `Ctrl+J` | New line (requires Kitty keyboard protocol) |
| `Alt+Enter` | New line (most terminals; see compatibility note below) |
| `\` + `Enter` | New line (works on all terminals — type a `\` and press Enter; the `\` is consumed) |
| `Esc` | Clear input / Cancel stream |
| `Esc` ×2 | Undo the previous turn |
| `Up/Down` | Browse input history |
| `Tab` | Accept suggestion |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear line |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word |
| `Ctrl+K` | Delete to end of line |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste image from clipboard (Windows: use `/paste`, see below) |

> **Terminal compatibility for newline chords:**
> - `Shift+Enter`, `Ctrl+Enter`, and `Ctrl+J` all need a terminal that speaks the Kitty keyboard protocol — kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, iTerm2 ≥3.5, Windows Terminal ≥1.21. Older terminals collapse them to plain `Enter` (which sends the message).
> - `Alt+Enter` works at the byte level on most terminals, but **Windows Terminal binds it to "toggle full screen" by default** — remove that binding under Settings → Actions to free it up.
> - Xshell does not support the Kitty protocol; in its keymap settings, map a free chord to send `ESC, Enter` (`\x1b\r`) to get the same effect, or paste multi-line text via the clipboard (bracketed paste is enabled).

> **Pasting images on Windows:**
> Windows Terminal and conhost bind `Ctrl+V` to their own `paste` action, which only forwards `CF_UNICODETEXT` from the clipboard — an image-only clipboard sends nothing, so the in-app `Ctrl+V` handler never fires. Two ways out:
> 1. Use **`/paste`** — the slash command pulls the clipboard image and attaches it as `[Image #N]`. Works in every terminal, including Windows Terminal, PowerShell 7, conhost, and git bash. The TUI's bottom-right hint on Windows says `Image in clipboard · /paste` automatically.
> 2. If you want `Ctrl+V` muscle memory: open Windows Terminal `settings.json` (`Ctrl+,` → "Open JSON file") and either delete the `{ "command": "paste", "keys": "ctrl+v" }` entry under `"actions"`, or rebind it to `ctrl+shift+v`. After a restart, `Ctrl+V` passes through to atomcode.
>
> Git Bash (MinTTY) doesn't intercept `Ctrl+V`, so it works there out of the box.

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Up/Down` | Scroll chat (3 lines) |
| `PageUp/PageDown` | Scroll chat (page) |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear conversation |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy selection |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel operation (double-tap to exit) |

## Architecture

AtomCode is a Rust workspace with four crates:

```
atomcode/
  crates/
    atomcode-core/     # Headless library — no TUI dependency
      agent/           # AgentLoop: autonomous tool-use loop
      turn/            # TurnRunner, datalog, permission decider
      config/          # Config loading, provider configs
      conversation/    # Message types, windowed context
      provider/        # LlmProvider trait + OpenAI/Claude/Ollama
      tool/            # Tool trait + built-in tool implementations
      session/         # Persistent sessions
      skill.rs         # User-defined skills

    atomcode-tuix/     # Terminal UI — retained-mode renderer (CC-style normal mode)
      event_loop/      # App state machine, command dispatch
      render/          # Cell-based renderer, diff, retained-mode frame loop
      modals/          # Picker UIs (dir, model, session, provider, issue)

    atomcode-cli/      # Binary entry point (TUI + headless -p mode)
      main.rs          # CLI args, first-run wizard, launch
      auth/            # AtomGit OAuth client

    atomcode-daemon/   # HTTP/SSE API server over atomcode-core
```

### Design Principles

1. **Tech-stack agnostic** — never hardcodes language-specific logic. Detects project type dynamically from descriptor files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, etc.).

2. **Decoupled agent** — `AgentLoop` runs as an independent async task, communicating with the TUI via channels (`AgentCommand` / `AgentEvent`). The core library has zero TUI dependencies, which is also what makes the daemon possible.

3. **Tool safety** — all destructive operations require explicit user approval. Tool failures become LLM observations, never panics.

4. **Context-aware** — token-budget-aware conversation windowing, project file-tree injection, and per-turn system reminders keep the model focused without exceeding context limits.

## Project Instruction File

Create a `.atomcode.md` file in your project root to give AtomCode persistent context:

```markdown
# Project Instructions

This is a Vue 3 + TypeScript project using Pinia for state management.

- Always use Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Use TailwindCSS for styling, no inline styles
- Run `npm run lint` after editing .vue/.ts files
```

AtomCode reads this file automatically and includes it in the system prompt. AtomCode also supports `AGENTS.md` (the [open standard](https://agents.md/) for AI coding agents) as an alternative — if both files exist, `.atomcode.md` takes priority.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.88+** — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git**
- A supported LLM provider API key (for runtime testing)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://atomgit.com/atomgit_atomcode/atomcode.git
cd atomcode

# Debug build (fast compilation, slower runtime)
cargo build

# Release build (slower compilation, optimized binary)
cargo build --release
```

### Run in Development

```bash
# Run the TUI directly (debug mode)
cargo run -p atomcode-cli

# With arguments
cargo run -p atomcode-cli -- -C /path/to/project
cargo run -p atomcode-cli -- --model gpt-4o

# Headless mode
cargo run -p atomcode-cli -- -p "summarize this repo"

# Daemon (HTTP API)
cargo run -p atomcode-daemon
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p atomcode-core
cargo test -p atomcode-tuix

# Run a specific test
cargo test -p atomcode-core test_name
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check compilation without building
cargo check

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Build and install to ~/.cargo/bin
cargo install --path crates/atomcode-cli
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! AtomCode is in active development.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository on AtomGit
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://atomgit.com/<your-username>/atomcode.git
   cd atomcode
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix
   ```
4. **Make your changes**, ensure the project builds and tests pass:
   ```bash
   cargo build && cargo test && cargo clippy
   ```
5. **Commit** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add xxx support"
   ```
6. **Push** and open a **Pull Request** against `main`

### Branch Naming

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring (no behavior change) |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `chore/` | Build, CI, tooling changes |

### Guidelines

- Follow the project's core principles — especially **tech-stack neutrality**
  (no language/framework-specific logic in the core engine; detect via probes
  like `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pom.xml` and route through adapters)
- All tool failures must be graceful — return the error as an observation to the LLM, never panic
- Destructive operations must require user approval
- Keep the system prompt compact (~1.5K tokens)
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before submitting

### Where to Start

- **Add a new tool** — implement the `Tool` trait in `crates/atomcode-core/src/tool/`
- **Add a new provider** — implement `LlmProvider` in `crates/atomcode-core/src/provider/`
- **Improve the UI** — rendering lives in `crates/atomcode-tuix/src/render/`
- **Fix bugs** — check [Issues](https://atomgit.com/atomgit_atomcode/atomcode/issues) for open bugs
