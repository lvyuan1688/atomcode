/// Composable around-tool wrapper — the SINGLE home for TOOL-level concerns
/// (rewrite args, gate/approve, transform results). The kernel runs every
/// middleware's `before` (in registration order) around each tool execution, then
/// every `after`. Distinct from `LifecycleHooks`, which is TURN-level.
///
/// ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING. Middlewares run in REGISTRATION ORDER: the `before`
/// chain forward (the first-registered runs first; the first to `Err` blocks and
/// stops the chain), then the `after` chain (also in registration order). This is
/// a documented contract, not an accident of iteration. Concretely: an approval
/// middleware that round-trips the user MUST be registered BEFORE a redaction
/// middleware that rewrites the call's args — otherwise the user approves bytes
/// different from what actually executes. Register the user-facing / gating
/// middleware first, arg-rewriting / transforming middleware after.
///
/// # PANIC CONTRACT (must-not-panic)
///
/// An implementation **MUST NOT panic**. The kernel does **NOT** isolate panics:
/// under the workspace `panic = "abort"` profile a panic ABORTS THE HOST PROCESS
/// (and `catch_unwind` is a no-op there), and under an unwind profile a panicking
/// middleware is not currently caught either — so a panicking `before`/`after`
/// takes down the whole session / process. Treat all injected code as
/// must-not-panic (the SAME trust posture as the tool-sandbox contract — see
/// [`crate::tool`]): to BLOCK a call, return [`BeforeOutcome::Deny`] from `before`; never panic.
