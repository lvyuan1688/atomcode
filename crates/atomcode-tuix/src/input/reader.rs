/// Burst-aggregation timeouts — how long the burst detector waits for the
/// next event before deciding the burst is over. A two-stage state machine
/// (DeepSeek-TUI's `paste_burst.rs` prior art) keeps lone keystrokes fast
/// while still coalescing real pastes:
///
/// - **PENDING** — the *first* peek after a candidate char. Normal typing
///   has human-scale gaps, so this short window expires and the single key
///   is emitted with near-zero added latency. Previously the full burst
///   timeout ran on *every* keystroke, which added a flat 15 ms per key on
///   Windows and read as input lag. A single small value on every OS: 4 ms
///   is below the ~13-20 ms perception floor, and being non-zero (vs a
///   strict `poll(0)`) gives a genuinely chunked first record a moment to
///   surface so a real paste isn't misread as a lone key.
/// - **ACTIVE** — adopted only *after* a 2nd candidate char confirms a
///   burst. The longer, per-OS bridging window that spans the gaps a
///   terminal takes to deliver chunked paste records:
///   - **Windows** (PowerShell / Windows Terminal / conhost): bracketed
///     paste payloads and char-by-char fallback arrive in chunked stdin
///     batches with 5-12 ms gaps; a 2 ms window split one logical Ctrl+V
///     into 5-10 `[Pasted #N]` placeholders. 15 ms swallows those gaps.
///     (Now that PENDING protects typing latency, this could be raised
///     toward the 60 ms prior-art value — left at 15 ms pending real
///     Windows verification.)
///   - **macOS / Linux**: bracketed paste arrives as one event in
///     practice; this only matters for the rare no-bracketed-paste
///     fallback. 4 ms covers occasional 2-3 ms gaps on slow SSH sessions.

///    a paste, leaving the buffer with `\n` between every CJK char and
///    the input row showing `首↵页↵中↵…`. Genuine multi-line pastes
///    always have lines with text; IME bursts have exactly 1 text char
