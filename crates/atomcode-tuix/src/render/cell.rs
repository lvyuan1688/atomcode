// Ink-style cell buffer for footer/menu rendering.
//
// The row-level diff we had before was correct but coarse: any byte change
// in a row triggered a full-row re-emit. Combined with UTF-8 rule characters
// (`─` is 3 bytes × 200 cols × 2 rules = 1254 bytes of rule per redraw) and
// footer-height oscillation when the slash palette opens/closes, every
// menu toggle pushed 1800+ bytes to Mac Terminal.app's GUI pipeline — the
// threshold where its coalesce + repaint latency becomes user-visible.
//
// Ink (Claude Code's renderer) works on cells: (char, style) pairs indexed
// by absolute terminal position. New frame → diff cell-by-cell → emit
// minimal patches. A row whose status stayed "glm-5 · ~/project" across
// frames contributes zero bytes. Rule middles stay identical after a
// single-column input change → zero bytes. This module gives us that
// primitive.
//
// Scope: footer + slash palette only. Body content (streaming text, tool
// output) keeps the pure-append path — body lines enter scrollback and
// never need a diff cycle.

/// JediTerm / IntelliJ-terminal repaint: serialise (prev → next) as a
/// per-changed-row **tight** stream, instead of the per-cell-CUP patch
/// stream [`serialize_patches`] produces.
///
/// Why a separate path: [`serialize_patches`] forces an absolute CUP before
/// every non-ASCII cell (see its body) so a width-misprediction degrades to
/// one wrong cell instead of a whole-row bleed. On JediTerm that very
/// CUP-per-glyph is what makes the terminal's narrow-fallback CJK paint show
/// a visible 1-col gap after every ideograph, and turns a rule of `─` into N
/// individually-positioned dashes that paint as a fragmented line.
///
/// JediTerm's GRID agrees with our width model (CJK = 2 cells), so we can
/// safely let the terminal advance its own cursor across a contiguous run.
/// For each row that changed: emit ONE `CUP(row,1)` + `EL` (erase the whole
/// line), then stream the row's cells up to its last non-blank column as a
/// single run — continuation cells skipped, SGR state-machined exactly like
/// [`serialize_row`]. This keeps box-drawing rules contiguous (symptom #3)
/// and the `EL` wipes any stale tail JediTerm left behind (symptom #2). It
/// deliberately does NOT change the per-ideograph gap (symptom #1) — that is
/// a font-advance artifact no escape sequence can fix.
///
/// Right-margin safety: streaming a full-width row writes the last column,
/// which leaves an xterm-class terminal (JediTerm included) in the *deferred*
/// "pending wrap" state — NOT an immediate line break. Every row here begins
/// with an absolute CUP, and `Screen::render_diff` always parks the cursor
/// with a final CUP after these bytes, so the pending wrap is cancelled
/// before any further glyph prints. No auto-wrap into the next row.
