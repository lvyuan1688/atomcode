//! The `<system-reminder>` convention — the ONE place that owns it.
//!
//! Runtime context (the per-turn status from [`StatusReminderHook`], plan-mode notices, …)
//! is injected into the conversation as a tail `Role::User` message WRAPPED in
//! `<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>`, so the model reads it as system-injected ambient
//! context rather than the user's own words. (The coding persona documents this contract to
//! the model; the Anthropic adapter coalesces the resulting user-after-user pair.)
//!
//! EVERY injector MUST build its reminder through [`system_reminder`] — that is the whole
//! point of centralizing the convention: the wrapper can no longer be forgotten. The bug
//! that motivated this: the date line was once emitted BARE (no wrapper), so the model read
//! it as the user's own words.
