//! Round-budget pressure: make the reviewer LAND findings before the round fuse trips.
//!
//! The failure this fixes: on a large/complex diff the reviewer can spend its ENTIRE round
//! budget in a shallow read/grep exploration loop, never calling `report_finding` and never
//! emitting a text-only stop. It then hits the `max_rounds` fuse with ZERO findings and the
//! whole review is scored as a hard failure ("no findings collected") — even though the
//! model saw the problem, it never committed it before running out of rounds.
//!
//! The model has no innate awareness of its remaining round budget. This hook projects it:
//! once rounds cross a threshold it appends an EPHEMERAL reminder (a synthetic user turn,
//! never stored — see [`pre_request`](atomcode_kernel::hook::LifecycleHooks::pre_request))
//! telling the model to stop broad exploration and report what it already has, escalating to
//! a hard "final round" nudge on the last executing round. It fabricates no findings; it only
//! forces the model to commit the ones it already believes in before the cutoff.
//!
//! Only active when `max_rounds` is set (engineering callers pass `--max-rounds`); a bare
//! unbounded CLI run has no budget to pressure against, so the hook is a no-op there.
