//! `atomcodex` — a standalone, single-capability CLI: code review. It drives the
//! `atomcode-review` agent (kernel + capabilities, no atomcode-core/atomcode-cli coupling)
//! over a `git diff`, then prints the structured findings the agent reported.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   atomcodex review [--base <ref>] [--staged] [--repo <dir>] [--model <m>] [--json]
//!
//! Provider creds resolve in precedence order: CLI flags > env (ATOMCODE_API_KEY /
//! ATOMCODE_BASE_URL / ATOMCODE_MODEL) > `~/.atomcode/config.toml`. From the config file
//! it reads the `[providers.<name>]` table named by `default_provider` (or `--provider`);
//! an `api_key` of the form `$VAR` is expanded from the environment. `api_key` is optional
//! (some gateways need none).
