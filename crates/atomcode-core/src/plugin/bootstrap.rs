//! First-startup install + per-startup sync hooks for the plugin
//! marketplace layer.
//!
//! Two distinct user journeys land here:
//!
//! 1. **Fresh install** — atomcode runs for the first time on a host
//!    that has never run it. The marker file
//!    `$ATOMCODE_HOME/.plugin_bootstrap_v2` does not exist. We `git clone`
//!    the official `atomcode-plugins-official` marketplace and touch the
//!    marker.
//!    Failure (no network, no git on PATH, upstream down) is logged
//!    and swallowed — startup proceeds without skills.
//!
//! 2. **Every startup** — we `git pull --ff-only` every installed
//!    marketplace so the plugins stay in sync with the remote.
//!    This runs on every launch (not just upgrades) so that new
//!    plugins published to official marketplaces are discovered
//!    promptly. Same swallowed-failure semantics.
//!
//! The marker file makes (1) a one-time event. If the user later runs
//! `/plugin marketplace remove atomcode`, the marker stays and we
//! respect their intent — no re-install on subsequent startups. To
//! force a re-bootstrap, the user can `rm $ATOMCODE_HOME/.plugin_bootstrap_v2`.
//!
//! Both functions are best-effort and never propagate errors —
//! atomcode must remain usable on offline machines, in air-gapped
//! corporate environments, on systems without git, etc.
